# Final Project "Klasifikasi Gambar"
Klasifikasi Gambar is the final project on a machine learning model I built using TensorFlow, which is capable of identifying images of a person's hand resembling the hand gestures of rock, paper, and scissors. This project was organized and reviewed by Dicoding Indonesia.

## Project Overview
* Dataset used: rockpaperscissors and wget command is: https://github.com/dicodingacademy/assets/releases/download/release/rockpaperscissors.zip.
* The dataset is divided into train set and validation set.
* The validation set size is 40% of the total dataset (training data has 1314 samples and validation data has 874 samples).
* Can implement image augmentation
* Can use image data generator.
* The model uses a sequential model.
* Model training takes no more than 30 minutes.
* The program is run on Google Collaboratory.
* The model accuracy limit is at least 85%.
* Can predict images uploaded to Colab
